# FlappyLumpy
A 2D game with our Lumpy ( a Penguin) ,  this is a variant of Flappy Bird game . It's work-project I do to improve myself.

I also add video of the game in the folder for seeing how is it going.

I added "game over" sound when the Lumpy hit the walls or get out from the camera view angle .
Every time when Lumpy passed new walls he get score ,
we can see the score table on the left top corner and during every point there is also sound like "collecting gold".
